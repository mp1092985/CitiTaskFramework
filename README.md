# CitiTaskFramework
Test after interview

Used below tools/technology for the project:
- Java 8, 
- Selenium webdriver, 
- Maven, 
- TestNG , (As instructed I was initially using Junit-5 but was facing challenges such as, execution was not happening at all and code run was failing as soon as I execute my code, debugging was also getting stuck at some point of the code.)
- Page factory
- implemented Page object model design pattern
- extent reports
- read data from properties files as well as from Excel files
- failure of any testcase will capture screenshot (after execution you can verify the screenshot in root directory of the project) 


• To run the code, you can run through testng.XML as a test suite
• Extent Report you can find in project root directory in Reports folder 


Please note : I have observed that if we run login test multiple times at a time, then Amazon will required to respond Sign-in attempt approval email to complete the login, 
I have not handled this as part of this frame work design.
So request you if needed please use below test email credentials to login to the email to approve the login request :
