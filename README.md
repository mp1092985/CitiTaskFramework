# CitiTaskFramework
Test after interview

Used below tools/technology for the project:
- Java 8, 
- Selenium webdriver, 
- Maven, 
- TestNG , (As instructed I was initially using Junit-5 but was facing challenges such as, execution was not happening at all and code run was failing as soon as I execute my code, debugging was also getting stuck at some point of the code.)
- Page factory
- implemented Page object model design pattern
- extent reports
- read data from properties files as well as from Excel files
- failure of any testcase will capture screenshot (after execution you can verify the screenshot in root directory of the project) 


â€¢ To run the code, you can run through testng.XML as a test suite

Extent Report you can find in project root directory in Reports folder
